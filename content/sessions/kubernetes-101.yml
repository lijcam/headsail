introduction: |-
    It's closing in on five pm, it's Friday afternoon. Excited about the weekend, you're already making mental notes on what you want to do on Saturday.
    One final sweep of the inbox before knock off, a last-minute request comes from one of the application teams.
    <blockquote>
     <b>From</b> pacman-development-team<br>
     <b>To:</b> deployment-engineering<br>
     <b>Subject:</b> Urgent app deployment<br><br>

    Hi deployment team,
    <br><br>
    Due to project timeline slippages, our next round of testing will be conducted over the weekend. We are also trialling a container-based delivery method of our application.
    Please ensure our application is deployed to the new OpenShift cluster before Saturday morning.
    <br><br>
    Login details and container images will be sent shortly.
    <br><br>
    Cheers,<br>
    Pacman Development Team

    This is the first time you've worked with Kubernetes, and so late on a Friday! Where do you start?

    Your task, run the container images using only the OpenShift console.

      Another email comes through with the location of the container images.
      The email also included specifics of how the containers should be deployed.
      You now have all the information you need to deploy the Pacman application.

      Explore the interface to find the [perspective switcher]{{highlight qs-perspective-switcher}} at the top of the navigation, and select **Developer**.
      The Developer perspective draws focus around the application and microservices for your projects and dissolves the complexity around networking, storage, and administration.
      
      Projects are a way for teams to organise their applications and content in isolation from other teams.
      More information on Projects can be found in the [working with projects](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/applications/projects/working-with-projects.html "Red Hat OpenShift documentation"){:target="_blank"} section of the OpenShift documentation.

      1. From the Developer perspective switch to your project - for example: _student-1_. 
      
      1. Enter the [Topology]{{highlight qs-nav-topology}}. The Mongo database has already been deployed, by clicking on the tile we can see additional details of the database deployment.

      1. In the navigation menu, click [Add]{{highlight qs-nav-add}}.

      1. Click [Add]{{highlight qs-nav-add}}, followed by `Container images`. Deploy the Pacman container using these parameters and click **Create**

        | Configuration                        | Parameter                          |
        |--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
        | Image name from external registry    | `quay.io/lijcam/pacman:v1`{{copy}} |
        | Runtime icon                         | nodejs                             |
        | Application Name                     | pacman                             |
        | Name                                 | pacman                             |
        | Create a route                       | tick                               |
      
      After completing our deployments, we can return to the [Topology]{{highlight qs-nav-topology}}. You will notice that the Pacman container has a small arrow symbol to the right of it. This links to the route of the application. Clicking it will take you to the Pacman application.
